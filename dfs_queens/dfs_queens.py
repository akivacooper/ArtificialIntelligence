"""There are five sections to my code
   1. Instruction Section
   2. Global Variable Section

See the Solution Section for the different solutions I've implemented.
Descriptions of each solution are above the function.
To test a solution, copy the solution name, and paste it into the run function in the Run Section
Note that solutions have variable number of handles which can be customized (like how many tries before a new iteration, and how many queens to place down each iteration).
See the description above each solution for the handles avaliable, and where to find them.
The General Use Function Section are for general use functions. Although 'general use' some solutions required specialized 'general' functions.
See the description above each solution in the Solution Section to see which general use functions a method uses

    4. Each box has a score, starting off at 0
    4. For each queen placed down, run through each  conflicting box in the mirror board, and add one to its score
    5. For each queen, only place down in a box whose score is 0. Then update all box scores on the board
    6. If there are not available boxes in the row with a score of 0 in the mirror board, continue through the search space using DFS
    7. When removing peices, make sure to remove them from the mirror board.
    8. This means, after removing the piece, run through the mirror board and decrement the score of each conflicting box
